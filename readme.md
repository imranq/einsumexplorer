Einsum Trainer:
Adaptive Quiz Engine:

Difficulty Adjustment: The quiz difficulty automatically adjusts based on the user's performance. Get a question right? The next one is harder. Get it wrong? The next one is easier.

Concept Mapping: Track which Einsum concepts the user is struggling with (e.g., understanding indices, contraction, broadcasting). Focus future questions on those weak areas.

Personalized Quizzes: Generate quizzes tailored to the user's current skill level and learning needs.

Interactive Question Types:

Visual Einsum Expression Builder:

The user builds the correct Einsum expression by dragging and dropping indices, tensor names, and the -> symbol. This forces them to actively think about the structure.

The app validates the expression as they build it, giving immediate feedback on syntax errors.

Tensor Shape Prediction:

Show the input tensors and a (potentially incomplete) Einsum expression. The user predicts the shape of the resulting tensor. This reinforces understanding of index manipulation.

Interactive Tensor Filling:

Show input tensors and an Einsum expression. The user fills in specific values in the resulting tensor (e.g., "What is the value at index [0, 1]?"). This connects the abstract notation to concrete calculations.

Instead of typing, the user can use a slider or number pad to select the value.

"Reverse Einsum":

Show the input tensors and the desired output tensor. The user must construct the Einsum expression that produces the output. This is a challenging but powerful way to internalize the logic.

Error Detection:

Show a "broken" Einsum expression or code snippet that's supposed to do something (like matrix multiplication). The user has to identify the error.

The user might have to select the line with the error or even drag and drop elements to fix it.

Smart Feedback System:

Immediate Validation: The app validates the user's answer as soon as they submit it.

"Explain My Mistake": If the user gets a question wrong, the app provides a detailed explanation of why their answer was incorrect and how to arrive at the correct answer. Don't just give the answer â€“ explain the reasoning.

Visual Debugging:

Show a step-by-step breakdown of the correct Einsum calculation, highlighting the elements being multiplied and summed.

Visually compare the user's (incorrect) approach with the correct approach, pointing out the differences.

Concept Links: Link the explanation to relevant concepts or "mini-lessons" that provide a refresher on the underlying principles.

Dynamic Problem Generation:

Procedural Content Generation: Generate new quiz questions on-the-fly, rather than relying on a fixed set of questions. This makes the quizzes more engaging and prevents users from memorizing the answers.

Parameter Variation: Vary the parameters of the quiz questions (tensor sizes, index names, operation types) to create a wide range of challenges.

Avoid Repetition: Track the questions the user has already answered and avoid repeating them too frequently.

Progress & Gamification:

Skill Tree/Graph: Visualize the user's progress through the various Einsum concepts. Show which concepts they have mastered and which ones they still need to work on.

Achievements/Badges: Award achievements for mastering concepts, completing quizzes, and achieving certain milestones.

Daily Challenges: Provide a daily set of quiz questions to encourage regular practice.

Streaks: Track the user's streak of correct answers to motivate them to keep learning.

Leaderboards (Optional): Let users compete with each other (carefully, to avoid discouraging beginners). Focus on friendly competition and personal improvement.

UI/UX:

Gamified Interface: Make the app feel like a game, with engaging visuals, sound effects, and animations.

Clean Design: Avoid clutter and focus on the quiz questions.
